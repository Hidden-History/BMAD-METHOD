  If you are looking for Version 4 of BMad Method, please note that you can
  still install it by using the command `npx bmad-method@latest install`, until v6 reaches beta.

  IMPORTANT Changes with Version Alpha.22 - PLEASE READ THIS if upgrading from earlier Alpha Versions:

  1. The BMad Core default output folder has changed from `docs` to `_bmad-output`. `docs`
  is meant for long-term artifacts, which you can always decide to move content to.

  2. If utilizing the BMad Method Module (BMM) please be aware of the following important recent changes:

  - Phases 1-3 (Analysis, Planning, Solutioning) will now default output to _bmad-output/planning-artifacts
  - Phase 4 (Implementation) will now default output to _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts
  - Long term project knowledge (research, docs, references, document-project output) will now default to docs/

  IT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED to align with these folder conventions instead of dumping all to docs/ - if you are upgrading from a prior
  version where all output was going to docs or docs/sprint-artifacts, it is suggested to reset configs to these new values.

  If you have anything in progress, you can move what was in sprint-artifacts to _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts,
  and if you had brainstorming content, a PRD, UX or Architecture, you can move the content to _bmad-output/planning-artifacts.

  🧠 NEW: Optional Memory System Available

  BMAD v6 now includes an OPTIONAL memory system that provides 85% token savings
  by remembering patterns, decisions, and code across workflows. Installation takes
  ~5 minutes after BMAD setup completes. Details will be shown at the end of installation.

  ✨ BMAD IS READY TO USE!

  🧠 OPTIONAL: Install Memory System for 85% Token Savings

  BMAD now includes an OPTIONAL memory system that provides persistent, searchable
  memory across your workflows. This enhancement is proven to save 85% on token usage
  while helping you avoid past mistakes and reuse successful patterns.

  To install the memory system (takes ~5 minutes):

    bash scripts/memory-setup.sh

  What you get:
  • Project Memory - Code patterns and story outcomes
  • Best Practices - Universal patterns learned across projects
  • Chat Memory - Decisions from agent conversations
  • Automatic context retrieval during workflows
  • Monitoring dashboards (Grafana + Streamlit)

  For details, see: docs/memory/README.md

  Memory installation is completely OPTIONAL. All BMAD workflows function
  perfectly without it. Install only if you want the token savings benefit.

  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  ONE FINAL NOTE WITH VERSION Alpha.22: Phase 4 (Implementation) is still in the process of
  being migrated to the improved workflow progressive disclosure system.
  Along with this, the full conversion to the new path locations for content being searched
  may possibly be incomplete. If you run a workflow that relies on finding input documents
  automatically, and you notice they are not being found / looking in the wrong location, either:
  1. Manually specify the correct input location when prompted
  2. Open an issue on GitHub so we can address the problem quickly if you think its a bug.
  3. Ensure your content is in the new locations for best results:
     - Planning Artifacts (Phases 1-3): _bmad-output/planning-artifacts
     - Implementation Artifacts (Phase 4): _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts
     - Long Term Project Knowledge (docs, research, references): docs/

  Thank you for helping test the early release version of the new BMad Core and BMad Method!
  Stable Beta coming soon - please read the full README.md and linked documentation to get started.
